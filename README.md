# Capstone Project: Commodity Market Forecasting

## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting commodity returns using global market data (LME, JPX, stocks, forex). The goal is to develop predictive models that support better risk management and trading strategies in volatile markets. It combines quantitative finance, machine learning, and systematic data analysis to tackle real-world financial challenges.

## Problem Statement
Commodity markets are highly volatile and influenced by global economic factors, impacting trading decisions, hedging strategies, and investment performance. Accurate forecasts can reduce portfolio risk, enhance decision-making, and improve market stability.  

## Objectives
- Develop predictive models for commodity returns using historical and macroeconomic data.  
- Evaluate model performance with robust metrics (e.g., RMSE, Sharpe ratio).  
- Explore feature engineering across multi-market datasets to capture macro-financial relationships.  
- Visualize predictions and insights for actionable trading and risk management strategies.  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook, GitHub for version control  

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning:** Aggregate and preprocess data from LME, JPX, forex, and stock markets.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create features that capture macroeconomic and market-specific signals.  
3. **Model Development:** Implement regression, time-series, and ML models to forecast commodity returns.  
4. **Evaluation:** Measure model accuracy and risk-adjusted performance using appropriate metrics.  
5. **Visualization:** Present results in interactive charts and tables for interpretability.  

## Results
- Early models indicate [In Progress].  
- Identified key market signals influencing commodity returns.  

## Future Work
- Enhance feature engineering with additional macroeconomic indicators.  
- Experiment with ensemble models and hyperparameter tuning for improved forecasts.  
- Deploy a dashboard for real-time market analysis and scenario simulation.  

## Timeline
- **Phase 1:** Data collection & preprocessing (Weeks 1–2)  
- **Phase 2:** Feature engineering & exploratory analysis (Weeks 3–4)  
- **Phase 3:** Model development & validation (Weeks 5–6)  
- **Phase 4:** Visualization, reporting & future planning (Weeks 7–8)
